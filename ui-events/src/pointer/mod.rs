//! # Pointer event types
//!
//! This module contains the core types for representing pointer input across
//! mice, pens, and touch. These types are transport-agnostic and can be
//! produced from platform backends (e.g. winit, web) and consumed in UI code.
//!
//! ## Key ideas:
//!
//! - [`PointerId`] and [`PersistentDeviceId`] help correlate states over time.
//! - [`PointerState`] carries position, pressure, tilt, modifiers and more.
//! - [`PointerEvent`] is the main event enum: down/up/move/enter/leave/scroll/gesture.
//! - [`PointerInfo::is_primary_pointer`] is a convenience for primary interactions.
//!
//! ## Example: checking for primary pointer and using logical coordinates
//!
//! ```
//! use ui_events::pointer::{PointerEvent, PointerUpdate};
//!
//! fn handle(ev: PointerEvent) {
//!     if let PointerEvent::Move(PointerUpdate { pointer, current, .. }) = ev {
//!         if pointer.is_primary_pointer() {
//!             let lp = current.logical_position();
//!             let _ = (lp.x, lp.y);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
